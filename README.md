# Welcome to the github page of 'Jonas Bellemans'

NOTE: Everything written below will be in english in stead of dutch as it's my second nature as a software developer/engineer.

## Introduction
This page acts as a kind of overview of the main projects i've done in the past. <br/>
Look at this page as a documentation blog which is also an addition to the 'work experience' requested on a CV.

## Licensing & remarks for the future me

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Jonas-Bellemans/Projects/edit/docs/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Jonas-Bellemans/Projects/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

@Me: Jekyll `jekyll-theme-hacker` theme was used ~ https://github.com/pages-themes/hacker
