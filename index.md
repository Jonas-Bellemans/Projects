# Projects

## Van den Braembussche: web visualizations
This is my most recent project (as time of writing this: 11/10/2020). <br/>

### Background
This company delivers concrete at construction sites (up to 50 construction sites/day).

The main problem is that scheduling still happens the "oldskool" way. 1 guy schedule everything the day before. The next day the schedule completely changes and alot of "Ã  la minute" decisions need to be made by experience. <br/>

Our solution proposes an local webapplication (running on their server) which gives a clear visualisation of the construction sites. This allows to customer to give better estimates of the scheduling of the constructions sites, the scheduling of the concurrent number of drivers which need to supply the construction sites, ...

### Screenshots

Grapical overview of driver schedules duren the day. It allows the customer to see whether they are able to supply all construction sites with alle the drivers available.

Overview of the driver schedule (each table represent a new construction site. Therefore the same driver might occur in multiple rows underneath eachother).
