# Welcome to the github page of 'Jonas Bellemans'
This page acts as a web portfolio to showcase projects and skills in better manner. <br/>
Look at this page as an addition to the 'work experience' requested on a CV.

**NOTE1**: Everything written below will be in english in stead of dutch as it's my second nature as a software developer/engineer. <br/>
**NOTE2**: Currently uses markdown to generate website layout -> future me will customize this portfolio to look like a real profesional portfolio. <br/>
